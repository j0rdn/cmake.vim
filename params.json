{"name":"CMake Support for Vim","tagline":"Incorporates the functionality of CMake into Vim.","body":"[![Stories in Ready][waffle:img])][waffle:link]\r\n# [CMake Interoperability in Vim][site]\r\n\r\n[`cmake.vim 0.5.0`][release] is a Vim plugin that aims to bind [CMake][cmake]\r\nwithin Vim for your CMake-based projects. This project has not reached a 1.0.0 \r\nrelease and thus isn't fully ready for production.\r\n\r\n# Installing\r\nI recommending using [Vundle][vundle] to install plugins. The line necessary\r\nto add this plugin is as follows:\r\n\r\n```viml\r\nBundle 'jalcine/cmake.vim`\r\n```\r\n\r\nReleases are made on Vim.org's scripts as well on patch-level releases.\r\n\r\n# Requirements\r\n`cmake.vim` is a **pure Vimscript** plugin, thus requiring nothing but Vim\r\nitself being over version 7.3 or greater. Patches to support older versions of\r\nVim are greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\nAfter you installed the plugin, just `cd` into the directory where the\r\ntop-level CMakeLists.txt can be found and run:\r\n\r\n```viml\r\n\" Create a new binary directory for your clean project.\r\n:CMakeCreateProject <build-dir-name>\r\n\r\n\" Build all of the targets.\r\n:CMakeBuild\r\n\r\n\" Clean up bad builds.\r\n:CMakeClean\r\n```\r\n\r\n`cmake.vim` does not bind to any keys by default.\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n`cmake.vim` defines a few methods for generic interaction with CMake. Check\r\nout `:help cmake-methods` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\nIn order for CMake to operate, it **has** to know where the build directory is\r\nlocated. This is done automatically by the plugin but it does need help in the\r\nevent that you happen to build your CMake project in a sub-directory. Check\r\nout `:help cmake-options` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe test suite is written using RSpec and Vimrunner. The following would do a\r\nfull unit test of the entire system:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle install && rake\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe project uses Guard as well for mildly automated tests.\r\n\r\n## Known Edgecases\r\n 1. If you use a header file as the source file, the plugin only knows of the\r\n    source files (which sometimes are generated) and doesn't update the\r\n   `b:cmake_target` variable correctly.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis code is released and available under the MIT license. Multiply and be\r\nfruitful.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\nI'm [Jacky Alcine][jalcine] and I like code. A lot. I also chat a lot like a\r\nfirehose so follow with caution!\r\n\r\n[vundle]: https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim\r\n[cmake]: http://cmake.org\r\n[syntastic]: https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic\r\n[ycm]: https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/\r\n[jalcine]: http://jalcine.me\r\n[vimux]: https://github.com/benmills/vimux\r\n[site]: http://jalcine.github.io/cmake.vim\r\n[release]: https://github.com/jalcine/cmake.vim/tree/v0.4.1\r\n[waffle:img]: https://badge.waffle.io/jalcine/cmake.vim.png?label=ready\r\n[waffle:link]: https://waffle.io/jalcine/cmake.vim\r\n","google":"UA-21819111-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
