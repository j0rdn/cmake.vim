{"name":"CMake Support for Vim","tagline":"Incorporates the functionality of CMake into Vim.","body":"[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/jalcine/cmake.vim.png?label=ready)](https://waffle.io/jalcine/cmake.vim)\r\n# [CMake Project Support in Vim][site]\r\n\r\n> With the power of gray skull, [CMake][] support in Vim is born. This allows for\r\n> CMake commands for building, installing, cleaning and invoking custom\r\n> targets within Vim. It makes uses of [vimux][] if found and can provide\r\n> integrations for [Syntastic][] and [YouCompleteMe][ycm].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[`cmake.vim 0.4.6`][release] is a Vim plugin that allows you to use [CMake][cmake]\r\nwithin Vim for your projects. **This is alpha-grade software and may turn your CMake\r\nproject into a cat-overrun Telnet session**.\r\n\r\nIf lost, run `:help cmake` for a bit of guidance.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nAt the time of writing, `cmake.vim` has been tested with Vim 7.3+ in nocp mode \r\nand CMake 2.8.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\nI recommending using [Vundle][vundle] to install plugins. The line necessary \r\nto add this plugin is as follows:\r\n\r\n```viml\r\nBundle 'jalcine/cmake.vim`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nAfter you installed the plugin, just `cd` into the directory where the\r\ntop-level CMakeLists.txt can be found and run:\r\n\r\n```viml\r\n\" Create a new binary directory for your clean project.\r\n:CMakeCreateProject <build-dir-name>\r\n\r\n\" Build all of the targets.\r\n:CMakeBuild\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that, you created (or re-configured in a vanilla-setup) a new binary\r\ndirectory and built the project.\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n`cmake.vim` defines a few methods for generic interaction with CMake. Check\r\nout `:help cmake-methods` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\nIn order for CMake to operate, it **has** to know where the build directory is \r\nlocated. This is done automatically by the plugin but it does need help in the \r\nevent that you happen to build your CMake project in a sub-directory. Check\r\nout `:help cmake-options` for more information.\r\n\r\n## Integrations\r\n\r\nSee `:help cmake-integrations` for tips on integrations `cmake.vim` with\r\nother plug-ins like [Syntastic][] or [YouCompleteMe][ycm]. Long story short, it's\r\nfreaking awesome but could use some work. With this version, the integrations are now\r\n*target-specific*, allowing for fine-grained integration for every single\r\nfile.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n  * With the more recent changes to [YouCompleteMe][ycm]; it's become a bit\r\n    difficult to dynamically add per-file flags. See \r\n    `:h cmake-integrations-ycm-setup` on how to configure YouCompleteMe with\r\n    CMake.\r\n\r\n  * Getting and setting variables is still rough around the edges.\r\n\r\n## To-Dos\r\n\r\n  [+] ~~Provide `:CMakeBuildTarget` that'd build the target provided. If a file is \r\n    to be provided, find the target for that file and build the target it\r\n    belongs to (restricted to source files).~~\r\n    * ~~Also for `:CMakeCleanTarget` since we can determine pre-target cleaning\r\n      information.~~\r\n  [+] ~~Improve integration's use flag lookup and discovery on a per-target basis\r\n    and a per-file basis (restricted to source files).~~\r\n  [+] ~~Pass an argument string to `:CMakeCreateBuild`.~~\r\n  [+] Allow setting and getting values using `:CMakeGetVar` and `:CMakeSetVar`.\r\n  * ~~Expose `cmake.vim`'s buffer commands only in `worthy` buffers.~~\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe test suite is written using RSpec and Vimrunner. The following would do a\r\nfull unit test of the entire system:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbundle install\r\nrake\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis code is released and available under the MIT license. Multiply and be \r\nfruitful.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\nI'm [Jacky Alcine][jalcine] and I like code. A lot. I also chat a lot like a \r\nfirehose so follow with caution!\r\n\r\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/jalcine/cmake.vim/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\r\n\r\n[vundle]: https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim\r\n[cmake]: http://cmake.org\r\n[syntastic]: https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic\r\n[ycm]: https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/ \r\n[jalcine]: http://jalcine.me\r\n[vimux]: https://github.com/benmills/vimux\r\n[site]: http://jalcine.github.io/cmake.vim\r\n[release]: https://github.com/jalcine/cmake.vim/tree/v0.4.1\r\n","google":"UA-21819111-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
